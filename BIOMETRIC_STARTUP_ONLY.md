# Biometric Authentication - Startup Only

## User Requirement
**"I only want biometric only once when app is started no where else"**

## Changes Made

### 1. Disabled Biometric on App Resume

**Problem**: Biometric was being checked when app resumed from background.

**Solution**: Disabled biometric checks in `AppLifecycleService._onAppResumed()`.

**Before**:
```dart
// Only check biometric if app was suspended (in background) and user was authenticated
if (_wasSuspended && _isAuthenticated) {
  // Biometric check logic...
}
```

**After**:
```dart
// Biometric check disabled - only happens at app startup
print('AppLifecycleService: Skipping biometric check on resume (only at startup)');
```

### 2. Added Initial Startup Flag

**Problem**: Biometric was being triggered during auth state changes.

**Solution**: Added `_isInitialStartup` flag to only do biometric at app startup.

**Implementation**:
```dart
bool _isInitialStartup = true; // Flag to track if this is the initial app startup

// In session check
if (_isInitialStartup) {
  await _checkBiometricAndNavigate();
  _isInitialStartup = false; // Mark that initial startup is complete
} else {
  // Not initial startup, go directly to map
  print('Not initial startup, going directly to map screen');
  setState(() {
    _currentScreen = const MapScreen();
    _isLoading = false;
  });
}
```

### 3. Updated Auth State Listener

**Problem**: Auth state changes were triggering biometric checks.

**Solution**: Removed biometric logic from auth state listener.

**Before**:
```dart
// User is signed in, set authenticated state and go to map screen
```

**After**:
```dart
// User is signed in, set authenticated state and go to map screen (no biometric check)
```

## Authentication Flow

### App Startup (Fresh Launch)
1. **App starts** → Check for existing session
2. **If session exists** → Biometric check (if enabled) → MapScreen
3. **If no session** → LoginScreen

### Google Login (After Startup)
1. **User clicks "Login with Google"** → OAuth flow
2. **OAuth success** → Direct to MapScreen (no biometric)
3. **No biometric check** during auth state changes

### App Resume (Background to Foreground)
1. **App resumes** → No biometric check
2. **Continue in current screen** → No interruption

## Key Features

### ✅ **Biometric Only at Startup**
- Biometric check happens **only once** when app is first launched
- No biometric checks when app resumes from background
- No biometric checks during auth state changes

### ✅ **Smooth User Experience**
- Google login → Direct to MapScreen (no biometric interruption)
- App resume → No biometric prompt
- Auth state changes → No biometric prompt

### ✅ **Proper State Management**
- Initial startup flag prevents multiple biometric checks
- Clear separation between startup and runtime behavior
- Proper authentication state tracking

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Fresh App Launch with Biometric Enabled
1. Enable biometric security
2. Close app completely
3. Launch app fresh
4. **Expected**: Biometric prompt → MapScreen

### 2. Fresh App Launch with No Biometric
1. Disable biometric security
2. Close app completely
3. Launch app fresh
4. **Expected**: Direct to MapScreen (no biometric)

### 3. Google Login After Startup
1. Launch app and go to login screen
2. Click "Login with Google"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Expected**: Direct to MapScreen (no biometric)

### 4. App Resume from Background
1. Login to app and use it
2. Put app in background
3. Bring app back to foreground
4. **Expected**: Continue in current screen (no biometric)

### 5. Auth State Changes
1. Login to app
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. **Expected**: Direct navigation (no biometric)

## Debug Logs

### App Startup with Biometric
```
Current session on app start: exists
User already signed in, setting authenticated state and checking biometric security at startup...
Checking biometric security...
Security enabled: true
Security enabled, showing AuthScreen for biometric verification
```

### App Startup without Biometric
```
Current session on app start: exists
User already signed in, setting authenticated state and checking biometric security at startup...
Checking biometric security...
Security enabled: false
No security enabled, going directly to map screen
```

### Google Login (No Biometric)
```
**** onAuthStateChange: AuthChangeEvent.signedIn
User signed in, setting authenticated state and navigating to map screen (no biometric check)
Successfully set current screen to MapScreen
```

### App Resume (No Biometric)
```
AppLifecycleService: App resumed from background
AppLifecycleService: Skipping biometric check on resume (only at startup)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/services/app_lifecycle_service.dart`**
   - Disabled biometric checks in `_onAppResumed()`
   - Added clear logging for skipped biometric checks

2. **`lib/main.dart`**
   - Added `_isInitialStartup` flag
   - Modified session check to only do biometric at startup
   - Updated auth state listener comments
   - Enhanced logging for startup vs runtime behavior

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ **No Interruptions**: Biometric only at startup, not during use
- ✅ **Smooth Login**: Google login goes directly to map
- ✅ **No Background Checks**: App resume doesn't prompt biometric
- ✅ **Predictable Behavior**: Users know when to expect biometric

### Security
- ✅ **Startup Protection**: Biometric still protects app at launch
- ✅ **Session Security**: Authentication state properly managed
- ✅ **No Over-Prompting**: Users aren't constantly asked for biometric

### Performance
- ✅ **Faster Navigation**: No biometric delays during auth changes
- ✅ **Reduced Overhead**: Fewer biometric checks
- ✅ **Better UX**: Smoother app transitions

## Prevention Measures

### Code Guidelines
1. **Use `_isInitialStartup` flag** for startup-only logic
2. **Avoid biometric in auth listeners** unless specifically needed
3. **Clear logging** for startup vs runtime behavior
4. **Test all scenarios** to ensure biometric only at startup

### Testing Strategy
1. **Test fresh app launch** with and without biometric
2. **Test Google login** after startup
3. **Test app resume** from background
4. **Test auth state changes** (sign out/in)
5. **Verify no biometric prompts** except at startup

The implementation ensures that:
- Biometric authentication happens **only once** when the app is started
- No biometric checks occur during Google login
- No biometric checks occur when app resumes from background
- No biometric checks occur during auth state changes
- Users have a smooth, uninterrupted experience after initial authentication
